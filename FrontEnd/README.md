## Setup

In order to build and run this web application, I suggest using the following docker commands.

> docker build -t contact-management-system_front-end .

> docker run -d --rm -p 80:3000 --name contact-management-system_FrontEnd contact-management-system_front-end

You can then visit http://localhost/ to view the web application.

_\* The docker build command only needs to be ran once. After the image is created, you can simply use the docker run command._
