## General info

I developed this Contact Management System in order to familiarize myself with CRUD RESTful APIs.

## Setup

In order to build and run this API, I suggest using the following docker commands.

> docker build -t contact-management-system_api .
> 
> docker-compose -p contact-management-system_api up

You can then use the ContactManagementSystem-collection.json file to make API calls.

_\* The docker build command only needs to be ran once. After the image is created, you can simply run the docker-compose command._
