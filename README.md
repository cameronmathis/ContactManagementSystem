## General info

I developed this Contact Management System Full Stack Application in order to familiarize myself with CRUD RESTful APIs.

## Setup

In order to view, visit [this think](http://34.132.35.75/). <br/>

In order to build and run this web application, I suggest using the following docker commands.

> docker build -t contact-management-system_front-end ./FrontEnd/

> docker build -t contact-management-system_api ./API/

> docker-compose -p contact-management-system up

_\* The two docker build commands only need to be ran once. After the images are created, you can simply run the docker-compose command._
